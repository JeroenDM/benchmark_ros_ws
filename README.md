# Benchmarking motion planners for industrial robots

This repository contains tons of git submodules, so clone with the `--recursive` option!
Using this repository allows you to reproduce the ROS workspace used for benchmarking motion planners by cloning a single repository, instead of manually setting it up or using wstool.

For instructions, look in the separate repositories for now ([here](https://github.com/JeroenDM/benchmark_runner/blob/master/README.md) is a good starting point).
I will try to gather all the docs in the wiki of this repository in the near future.
